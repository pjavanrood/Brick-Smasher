Brick Smasher
==================
This mini-project is an implementation of the popular vintage game, the Brick Smasher. The logic is very simple, there is a paddle, that moves horizontally, and a ball that bounces and destroy the bricks as it hits them. I programmed it in C++ and used the SDL library for graphics. Since C++ is a low-level language and SDL library is just a graphical library, it does not provide built-in functions for creating a GUI, therefore I had to design everything such as the icons, buttons, menus, etc from scratch. Below you can see a gameplay:
